# Guitar Buying Manufacturing Specifications Guide for Guitar Players

## A NuCamp Project

## Portfolio Project Perspectives
One of the most interesting questions I get asked as a guitar instructor is: "what paramaters are relevant to buying a guitar?" The answer, like most issues in life, varies with the needs of the student, or musician asking the question. While most beginner players don't really need a lot of information to get them started, potentially realizing that too much overkill on specifics might end up killing their "enjoyable" new hobby, they do often need solid technical data to inform them and educate them to make future musical decisions and purchases. Advanced, or pro-level players, often need a great deal more information on each instrument, and a way of comparing relevant brands and models for their particular musical needs. For these reasons I have decided to attempt a manufacturer-driven specification guide to electrical guitars for my Bootstrap project; with an optimistic hope to extend this to an honors project, or as a part of a larger honors package for graduation. 

## Prospective Features for Website Users
- Guitar feature comparison tables
- Links to major manufactuers
- diferences in product features
 - Model differences (proprietary and general)
 - differences between different brands in their approach to manufacturing and marketing instruments
- Contact information to aid musicians in both informing their searches, and to update bugs, or improvements needed to the website
- Links to reviews and retail purchase sites
-Initial version will be a POC using Ibanez as the only brand
    -Using Ibanez is useful due to the Company's transparent parts/sales/marketing featured right on the Ibanez USA site

## Prospective technology
- Bootstrap
- Node.js for server-side scripting
- Mongo.db if we get that far and extend into backend course with this project
- HTML 
- css
- javascript
- git
- GitHub repositories

## Layout

## Market Survey & Research

While current websites by manufacturers give specifications on each guitar model, often you must look to a maintenance spec sheet, retail outlet marketing, and potentially online reviews...who many times must contact the company for their info...in order to get detailed, and accurate, information on a particular instrument. Most consumers rely on a single point of contact with the company, often provided by a retail outlet; this can be useful, but not often fully relevant, detailed, or understandable.
