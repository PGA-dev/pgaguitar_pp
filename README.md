## Portfolio Project Perspectives
One of the most interesting questions I get asked as a guitar instructor is: "what paramaters are relevant to buying a guitar?" The answer, like most issues in life, varies with the needs of the student, or musician asking the question. While most beginner players don't really need a lot of information to get them started, potentially realizing that too much overkill on specifics might end up killing their "enjoyable" new hobby, they do often need solid technical data to inform them and educate them to make future musical decisions and purchases. Advanced, or pro-level players, often need a great deal more information on each instrument, and a way of comparing relevant brands and models for their particular musical needs. For these reasons I have decided to attempt a guide site to all guitar related buying. 

## Prospective Features for Website Users
- Links to major manufactuers
- diferences in product features
 - Links to buying guides
 - YouTube links to gear demo vids
 - eventually I will update a great deal of my own knowledge, when this goes live, for how to buy guitar gear, but for now I need to keep it simple.

## Prospective technology
- React
- Node.js for server-side scripting
- Mongo.db if we get that far and extend into backend course with this project
- JSX 
- css/SCSS
- Mostly Vanilla Javascript
- gitlab for local git editing
- GitHub repositories

## Market Survey & Research

While current websites by manufacturers give specifications on each guitar model, often you must look to a maintenance spec sheet, retail outlet marketing, and potentially online reviews...who many times must contact the company for their info...in order to get detailed, and accurate, information on a particular instrument. Most consumers rely on a single point of contact with the company, often provided by a retail outlet; this can be useful, but not often fully relevant, detailed, or understandable.
